It's able to generate textures from a single input image. It's able to do this because it has looked on thousands of images of normal maps, height maps, diffuse maps and so on. From what it has seen in the past it's able to generate a prediction of textures from any kind of input image. How to use it It's fairly straightforward to use, once it's installed. just navigate to blenders shader editor, and open the sidebar (hotkey: \"n\") and click the tab \"Texture Splitter AI\" and the button \"Load AI\" A new window will pop up, and here you can click the load Image button. Select your desired image, and click the \"generate textures\" button. The time it takes to generate textures depends on your image size, and you graphics card. How does it work? The program splits input image to squares of 256x256. This is simply because it's too heavy to run the AI on larger images (like 4k images). It will freeze your computer (trust me, I've tried). Then once it's done with all the \"patches\" of your image, I use another AI to stitch them together again. \"Why use another AI?\" I hear you ask. Well my curious friend, it's simply because if I just put the patches back together, the image will look tiled. Reason is, there might be slight differences between the results of each patch and then the border will of each patch will be visible. Tips and tricks The addon will accept UV maps. The way it handles is by inpainting. This means If you load an image with an alpha channel, it will try and paint in the empty area with a nearest neighbor algorithm. sometimes you will encounter that the normal map direction is wrong. Just seperate the RGB channels invert R and G and merge them back together again","title":"Home"},{"location":"#texture-splitter-ai","text":"Made by Asger Suhr Langhoff","title":"Texture Splitter AI"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Texture Splitter AI is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), discovered by Ian Goodfellow in 2014.

Roadmap 5 AI's for generating textures Make it accept any image size fix memory issues on large images UV support seamless AI stitching of image patches remove secondary window and implement completely into Blenders UI fix Linux installation When training GANs train on 512x512 images and split them into four, feed them to the generator and stitch them together afterwards. Then give them to the discriminator, hopefully this will teach the generator to create better edges for stitching images together again. Maybe even random sized tiles that are fed to the generator. implement Super Resolution GAN to remove need of stitching, and improve perfomance (idea)","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"Texture Splitter AI is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), discovered by Ian Goodfellow in 2014.
