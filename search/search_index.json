It's trying to remove the hassle of creating all the different texture maps, that make up a PBR texture. How to use it It's fairly straightforward to use, once it's installed. just navigate to blenders shader editor, and open the sidebar (hotkey: \"n\") and click the tab \"AI Splitter\". Here you can click the load Image button. You can chose between two methods, \"Simple\" or \"Resize\". The \"Simple\" mtehod simply takes the image as it is and runs the AI's on the image. The \"Resize\" method takes the image and resizes it for the AI's. Both methods will return an image of the same dimensions as the original image, the reason for the resize option is to avoid too big computations. Now Click the \"generate textures\" button. The time it takes to generate textures depends on your image size, and you graphics card. When it's done you can click the \"Add to Material\" button, which will add the textures to the current material, in a little neat node group. Tips and tricks The addon will accept UV maps. The way it handles is by inpainting. This means If you load an image with an alpha channel, it will try and paint in the empty area with a nearest neighbor algorithm. sometimes you will encounter that the normal map direction is wrong. Try flipping the G channel or R channel","title":"Home"},{"location":"#texture-splitter-ai","text":"Made by Asger Suhr Langhoff","title":"Texture Splitter AI"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Texture Splitter AI is a neural network.

Neural networks are alghorithms, that are extremely good at pattern recognition. they aree widely used for recognising objects in images or videos, but has also in the recent years made its way into other fields. Texture Splitter AI is using this technology to be able to generate textures from a single input image. It's able to do this because it has looked on thousands of images of normal maps, height maps, diffuse maps and so on. From what it has seen in the past it's able to generate a prediction of textures from any kind of input image. Roadmap 5 AI's for generating textures Make it accept any image size fix memory issues on large images UV support seamless AI stitching of image patches remove secondary window and implement completely into Blenders UI fix Linux installation remove need for stitching Automatic tiling option, maybe train a smaller AI to fix tiling improve performance by moving all of computations to c++ instead of python","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"Texture Splitter AI is a neural network.
